# Homework Assignment

This assignment covers the first week of the Intermediate Bootcamp. This repository contains 3 test files, each covering a single task. The order of the tasks does not matter. **You can complete them in any order.** Try to complete as many of them as you can. 

First run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Run the tests with the command `npm test`. Read the instructions in this document to know what is expected of you. The tests are meant to _help_ and _guide_ you. Passing tests do **NOT** automatically mean a successful implementation. **Again, tests do not equal score!** You can read the tests to see exactly what it's expecting, especially if you're getting errors. However, do **not** change the tests.

**Make sure to hand in the project the way you received it!** The tests should still work and be runnable with the `npm test` command after you hand in your homework.

You can also run the tests for each assignment individually by executing `npm run test1`, `npm run test2` and `npm run test3`.

If you want to play around with your code yourself (not using the provided tests), here's a tip. Instead of adding test code to your solution files, create a new `.js` file and run it with `node`.

_Note: we'll use the results of this homework assignment for a formal evaluation and as such you should write the code individually. **Plagiarism is a violation of the Academy contract and is not in your best interest. Do not discuss the contents of the assignment with your fellow students.**_

## How to submit your results

**Send your homework to teachers@codaisseur.com before Saturday 22:00**

Clean up your code:

- Fix the formatting/indentation
- Remove unnecessary code.

The app should be runnable simply by cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running `npm test`.

## Instructions

### Assignment 1: ShoppingCart

1. You must create a module named `ShoppingCart`. The module must export a `class`! In other words your `module.exports` is not an object, a string, or anything else, but only a class.
1. Given a brand new instance of the class in a variable `cart`, calling `cart.getItems()` should return an empty array.
1. The class should have a method `cart.addItem(itemName, quantity, price)`, which adds a new item to an internal array.
1. After adding items, a call to `cart.getItems()` should return an array that includes the added items.
1. Items in the array should be in this format:
    ```js
    {
      name: "Name of the item",
      quantity: 1,
      pricePerUnit: 99.99
    }
    ```
1.  Calling `cart.clear()` should remove all items from the items array. Meaning, the next call to `getItems()` should return an empty array.
1.  Calling `cart.total()` should return the total value of the shopping cart. Meaning, the sum of the cost of each cart item. The cost of each item is its `pricePerUnit` multiplied by the `quantity`. **Use `reduce`!**

### Assignment 2: transform

1.  You must create a module named `transform` that exports a function named `groupAdultsByAgeRange`. The test imports it like this:
    ```js
    const groupAdultsByAgeRange = require("./transform").groupAdultsByAgeRange
    ```
    _Note: This is a named export_
1.  The exported `groupAdultsByAgeRange` should be a function.
1.  The function will be called with an array of objects as its argument. The objects represent people, with a property `name` and a property `age`. Your function should group each person **over the age of 18** into age ranges. Here are a few examples:
    ```js
    // Example 1
    groupAdultsByAgeRange([{name: "Henry", age: 9}, {name: "John", age: 20}])
    // Should result in:
    const result = { '20 and younger': [ { name: 'John', age: 20 } ] }

    // Example 2
    groupAdultsByAgeRange([{name: "Anna", age: 31}, {name: "John", age: 32}, {name: "Hank", age: 60}])
    // Should result in:
    const result2 = { 
      '31-40': [ { name: 'Anna', age: 31 }, { name: 'John', age: 32 } ],
      '51 and older': [ { name: 'Hank', age: 60 } ] 
    }
    ```
1. Notice that the groups are only added to the resulting object if they are not empty. Make sure your function does the same.
1. You should use a combination of `filter` and `reduce`. If your solution uses `for`-loops instead of `reduce` for creating the **final object**, you will receive partial points. The use of `for`-loops is allowed, but try to construct the returned "grouping" object using `reduce`.
1. These are the groups that your code needs to return. Use the text as the name of the property:
    - `20 and younger`
    - `21-30`
    - `31-40`
    - `41-50`
    - `51 and older`

### Assignment 3: Asynchronous code

1. You must create a module named `async-functions`. The test imports it with
    ```js
    const {
      getTatooineResidents,
      promiseMeAString,
    } = require("./async-functions")
    ```
    _Note: There should be **2** named exports that should all be functions_

1. The function `getTatooineResidents` 
- Makes a request to the starwars api endpoint: https://swapi.co/api/planets/1/ to get info about the planet Tatooine
- Feel free to use npm to install a http client like superagent to make the request
- Making a request with superagent should create a Promise
- Use `.then` to get the response and make The promise resolve with `only` an array of urls for the residents of Tatooine (not the whole response)
   
1. The function `promiseMeAString`
- This function should return a Promise
- If promiseMeAString is called with a string like: `promiseMeAString('I Promise!')`, te Promise should resolve with "You kept the Promise!"
- If promiseMeAString is called with null like: `promiseMeAString(null)`, te Promise should reject with "You have failed me!"
